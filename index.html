                Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects. 
Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library. 
Python was created in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC language. Python 2.0, released in 2000, introduced features like list comprehensions and a garbage collection system with reference counting.
Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible, and much Python 2 code does not run unmodified on Python 3.
The Python 2 language was officially discontinued in 2020 (first planned for 2015), and "Python 2.7.18 is the last Python 2.7 release and therefore the last Python 2 release‚Äù No more security patches or other improvements will be released for it. With Python 2's end-of-life, only Python 3.6  and later are supported.

because Python is a language that can be used for developing anything and everything you want.
Although it's an interpreted language, it's used widely because it's easier to write code and understand. When I started as a beginner, I found Python to be a very friendly language as it was easier to read and understand.
It has a huge set of libraries that can be used to do anything that you can think of doing with a programming language.
Python developer community across the world has been doing a great job in helping people with issues and most of the stuff is very well documented and easy to understand and implement.
The documentation provided by the guys who developed Python is pretty good and very very clear and understandable. Documentation for a lot of languages is pretty hard to understand, but Python documentation doesn't fall into that category.
You have a manual task to Automate, Python can help you do that. You are interested in Machine learning or data science, there are a bunch of awesome, well documented libraries available for Python. NoSQL database libraries, Web development libraries are very good and is used extensively for various Use cases like hosting a website, REST Api etc. Honestly, This list is endless.
A simple Google search would reveal all that you can do with it!
